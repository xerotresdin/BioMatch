# BioMatch

Inspiration
Our project, BioMatch, was born out of a shared passion for making clinical trials more accessible to a wider range of participants. We were inspired by the potential for clinical trials to advance medical research and improve healthcare outcomes but recognized that many potential participants faced barriers in finding and enrolling in trials that matched their demographics and preferences. The idea for BioMatch came about when one of our team members had a family member diagnosed with a rare medical condition. They struggled to find relevant clinical trials, and when they did, they were often met with complex eligibility criteria that made it difficult to determine if they were a suitable candidate. This personal experience motivated us to create a solution that simplifies the process of finding and applying for clinical trials.

What it does
How we built it
Data Gathering and Preparing We collected data from various sources, including clinical trial databases, medical research publications, and demographic information repositories. This data formed the foundation for our compatibility algorithm.

Compatibility Algorithm We designed and implemented an algorithm that takes a user's demographics and preferences into account to rank clinical trials. This algorithm considered factors like age, gender, location, medical history, and trial eligibility criteria to provide personalized recommendations.

User Interface Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface was essential. We designed a web-based platform that allowed users to input their demographics and preferences easily. The platform then displayed a ranked list of compatible clinical trials, along with detailed information about each trial.

Testing We conducted extensive testing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our compatibility algorithm. Deployment Once we were confident in the functionality and usability of BioMatch, we deployed it to a web server, making it accessible to users.

Challenges we ran into
While developing BioMatch, we encountered several challenges:

Data Quality Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the data we collected was a significant challenge. We had to clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis.

API Integration Integrating multiple APIs with varying data structures and authentication methods was complex. We had to develop robust error handling and data synchronization mechanisms to maintain a seamless user experience.

Algorithm Complexity Designing a compatibility algorithm that could handle diverse user inputs and produce meaningful results required a deep understanding of data science and machine learning. We had to iterate on the algorithm several times to improve its accuracy and performance.

User Privacy Handling sensitive demographic and medical information raised privacy concerns. We are currently trying to implement strict data security measures to protect user data and comply with relevant regulations.

What we learned
Git Collaboration Working on BioMatch was one of our first experiences with collaborative software development using Git and version control. We quickly learned the importance of well-organized branches, clear commit messages, and regular code reviews to avoid conflicts and maintain a cohesive codebase.

Integration of Multiple APIs To provide users with a comprehensive list of clinical trials, we had to integrate multiple APIs from various sources. This was a challenging but enlightening experience. We learned how to make API requests, handle data responses, and ensure that the information displayed to users was accurate and up-to-date.

Algorithm Development The heart of BioMatch lies in the compatibility algorithm we developed. We had to dig deep into data analysis and machine learning techniques to create a system that could assess a user's demographics and preferences and rank clinical trials accordingly. This was a steep learning curve, but it allowed us to gain valuable insights into data-driven decision-making.
